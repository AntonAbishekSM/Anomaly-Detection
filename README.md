# Anomaly-Detection in Network Traffic with Autoencoder
In this project, an autoencoder-based anomaly detection system was developed to identify unusual patterns in network traffic, using data collected with Wireshark. The network traffic was captured in .pcap format, which was subsequently converted to CSV format for analysis. This dataset, representing real-world network traffic, was used to build and train an unsupervised anomaly detection model. The data was preprocessed by scaling it between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. An autoencoder neural network was then designed with two main components: an encoder to compress the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder to reconstruct the original input. The model was trained on normal traffic data, with the assumption that the majority of the data was non-anomalous. After training, the model was evaluated on test data, where the reconstruction error (mean squared error) was computed for each instance. Anomalies were identified by setting a threshold based on the 95th percentile of the reconstruction error, flagging instances with high reconstruction errors as potential anomalies. The results were visualized using a histogram of the reconstruction error, and a number of anomalies were successfully detected, providing insights into unusual network behavior. This approach allows for effective real-time detection of network anomalies, making it a valuable tool for cybersecurity applications, such as identifying denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, malicious network activity, or any other abnormal traffic patterns.
